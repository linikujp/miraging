This folder contains the graphic design of modeling core-constructs and their relations in MIAGO and the implemented miago OWL file.
/'vue graphic'	all the vue graphic views of the design. The Visual Understanding Environment (VUE) tool has to be downloaded from http://vue.tufts.edu/


Others are OWL files contain some modelings. To use these files: Change the name to miago.owl and copy to the src\ replace the miago.owl file. 

miago_modeling_001.owl   
    The ontology basic modeling using 'evidence role' to link a conclusion and evidence role, then define the evidence so conclusion become evidence.

miago_modeling_002.owl
    Use 'conclusion used as evidence' to link a conclusion and evidence directly.
	
migao_modeling_003.owl -- putatively
    Use 'miRNA target assumption based on' relation to directly link an assumption with a conclusion. This way is more straight forward, but then evidence of miRNA down regulating target mRNA expression can not be linked directly.

4/27/2015: we use model 1. Model 1 has to be obsolete. Because the domain of evidence role can't be GDC. https://sourceforge.net/p/obi/obi-terms/762/
4/28/2015: Currently we use model 2.
