The microRNA for aging project.

It includes two parts: the MIAGO ontology and RDF dataset that uses MIAGO's semantics.

Python code transferring spreadsheet of curated data to RDF/OWL format was included.

MIrna and AGing Ontology(MIAGO).  It represents the experimernt that observes the functional miRNA and target protein in the aging domain. This ontology gives logical definitions to classify miRNA target based on both computational prediction and experimental validation.
